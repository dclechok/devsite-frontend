    <p>
      Hi. My name is Daniel C. Lechok, and I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
      After working in logistics for many years, I decided to finally take the
      leap into full-stack engineering and follow my dream of becoming a
      full-time software developer.
      <br />
      <br />
      I've always had passion for creativity and software development, and no
      matter what I've done in life, professionally, the desire to become a
      software engineer has never left me.
      <br />
      <br />
      After years of programming as a hobbyist, followed by taking college
      courses in software development, and most-recently becoming a graduate of
      the Thinkful coding bootcamp I'm more than ready to pair my years of
      experience in logistics along with my new skills in full stack
      engineering, and find a new career in full stack development. I also have
      the drive and dedication to build your project to your highest
      expectations.
    </p>
